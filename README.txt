## Refer to paper "Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning on Primary Tumor Biopsy Slides"

- [ ] test.ipynb -> playground
- [ ] bag_loader.py -> load data
- [ ] models.py -> CNN using vgg16, aggregate feature follow the paper, and classification 
- [ ] TODO: need to write evaluate functions, for now, just few examples in train.py
- [ ] trian.py -> main

- [ ] crop_wsi.py

Thanks for your interest in our BCNB: Early Breast Cancer Core-Needle Biopsy WSI Dataset, this dataset is firstly introduced in our paper "Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning on Primary Tumor Biopsy Slides".
